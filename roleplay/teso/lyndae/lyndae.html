                <strong>date</strong>&gt; at &lt;
                <strong>location</strong>&gt;. She is an imperial, but living among the &lt;
                <strong>race</strong>&gt;. She spent most of her time helping her father at the smith, mostly learning how to build imperial gear and improving them. She decided to follow this path, becoming herself a smith. At the age of 21, she found a 2 months old monkey that she kept, naming him
                <em>Hammer</em>. She trained him, teaching him basic tasks like bringing tools to her, so that he could help her at the smith. One year ago, she decided to buy an imperial horse, which was 4 year old at this moment."</p>
